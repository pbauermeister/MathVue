# MathVue

Re-implementation of [MathVision](https://github.com/pbauermeister/MathVision) with these technologies:
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)
- [asm.js](http://asmjs.org/)

There is no backend. Sharing formulas will be done using APIs of cloud file hosting services (e.g. Dropbox).
